# Weasley Family Clock

This script controls the family location clock project I built. Inspired and aided in part by www.hackster.io/wgbartley/word-clock-v2-26adee. Messages are sent to the Photon in the format of the capitalized initial of the person, a space, and then the location descriptor in lowercase.
